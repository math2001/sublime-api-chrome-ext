# Sublime API Chrome Extension

Here's what you'll get if you use this extension:

it's not perfect (pretty far from it), but I prefer to have this side bar.

## Installation

As you probably guessed, this is an extension for *Google chrome* only. 

1. Download the [`sublime-api`](http://github.com/math2001/sublime-api-chrome-ext/sublime-api.crx) (you can use [git zip](http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/))
2. Open the extension chrome page (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Drag the file into this page.

Done! Open [The Sublime Text 3 API](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html).
