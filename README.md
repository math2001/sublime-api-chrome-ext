# Sublime API Chrome Extension

Here's what you'll get if you use this extension:

![demo](demo.gif)

it's not perfect (pretty far from it), but I prefer to have this side bar.

If you want to download the code to change it, or just to make sure you know that the extension you're using is safe (because you can see the code), do the following steps:

1. clone this repo wherever you want on your computer
2. open the extensions chrome page (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Tick the box `Developer Mode`
4. click on `Load unpacked extension...`
5. select this repo's folder
6. click `ok`

Done
